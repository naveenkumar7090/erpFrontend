- Due dates and payment tracking

## Important Notes

### Data Persistence

- **All changes are temporary** when in demo mode
- Data is stored in localStorage only
- Changes will be reset when demo mode is disabled

### No API Calls

- Demo mode operates entirely on the frontend
- No network requests are made
- Perfect for offline demonstrations

### Switching Modes

- You can exit demo mode at any time
- Exiting will clear all demo data
- You'll be redirected to the login page

## Technical Implementation

### Demo Service

- Located at `src/services/demoService.js`
- Manages all demo data and functionality
- Simulates API responses with realistic delays

### Redux Integration

- Demo mode state is managed in Redux
- All slices support demo mode operations
- Seamless switching between demo and regular modes

### Local Storage

- Demo mode status is persisted in localStorage
- User data is cached for session persistence
- Easy to reset by clearing browser data

## Customization

### Adding More Sample Data

Edit `src/services/demoService.js` and add data to the `initializeDemoData()` method:

```javascript
// Add new entities
newEntity: [
  {
    id: "new-001",
    name: "Sample Item",
    // ... other properties
  },
];
```

### Modifying Demo User

Update the user object in the demo service:

```javascript
user: {
  // ... existing properties
  newProperty: "New Value";
}
```

### Adding New Demo Methods

Create new methods in the demo service:

```javascript
async getDemoNewEntity() {
  return this.simulateApiCall(this.getDemoData("newEntity"));
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Demo Mode Not Working

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Clear localStorage and try again
3. Ensure all components are properly imported

### Data Not Loading

1. Verify demo mode is enabled
2. Check Redux state for demo mode status
3. Refresh the page if needed

### Performance Issues

1. Demo mode includes realistic API delays
2. Adjust delay values in `simulateApiCall()` method
3. Consider reducing sample data size for large datasets

## Support

For issues or questions about demo mode:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify Redux state in Redux DevTools
3. Review the demo service implementation
4. Check component imports and dependencies
